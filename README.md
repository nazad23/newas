# Problem
### Write a function that accepts two or more number values and returns the average of those values. Values that are string representations of numbers should be converted to numbers and included in the average as well. The function should throw an error if any given value is not a number or cannot be converted to a number.

# How To Run
### Copy and paste functions and test cases into google chrome browser
### You can also run test cases locally by installing the Code Runner plugin in VS Code
